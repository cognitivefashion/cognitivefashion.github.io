Natural Language Semantic Search for ABOF
<!--more-->

<img src="/img/portfolio/abofnls_2.jpg" width="600">

The search on abof e-commerce site was powered by the Natural Language Sematic Search (NLS) asset from IBM Research Cognitive Fashion. NLS allows the user to search a fashion e-commerce catalog using complex natural language queries (e.g. `Show me some black graphic tees for my girlfriend under 1k`). The NLS is grounded in the fashion taxonomy and can understand various apparel, accessories and footwear names and the various attributes like category, color, pattern/print, brand (understands various brand abbreviations), style, price (can handle under, above, around and currency denotations.), sale/discount, fabric/material, occasion, size, fit, themes etc. Also handles query back off, color substitution, brand substitution and spelling correction tuned to the fashion taxonomy. 

> NLS resulted in a substantial improvement in PDP click through rate and percentage of queries with zero results was significantly reduced.
