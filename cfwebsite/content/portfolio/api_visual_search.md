[API documentation](https://cognitivefashion.github.io/slate/#visual-search) | [Demo](http://cfdemosflagship.mybluemix.net/)

For consumers who are unsure of exactly what they want, or they’ve seen something that’s inspired them in the real world, but can’t put it into words, visual search will help accelerates the discovery process.

## Use cases

1. `Share & Shop`  Take a picture or upload saved image or screenshot and discover products that are visually similar. 
1. `Creative Discovery`  Content writers, designers or fashion stylists can find matching catalog items based on selected photograph (“which dress best resembles this painting” etc.)
