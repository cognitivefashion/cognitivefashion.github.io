Inspirational Search for Custo Barcelona at Lanzarote Fashion Weekend 2018

IBM build a tool for Custo Barcelona for its new capsule collection inspired by the landscapes of Lanzarote. The new collection was demonstrated at the Lanzarote Fashion Weekend on May 12, 2018.  The tool compared the entire collection of Custo Barcelona?s design images of the last 10 years with the image bank of the Canary Island to facilitate design inspiration that reflect the essence of these two worlds. The tool uses Visual Search and Browse APIs to come up with similar images. Custo Dalmau has found this AI tool very useful, since it allowed accelerating the research process, which can be used to create a new collection. It has been a fresh and timeless way to review your own aesthetic and a starting point for the new collection.
