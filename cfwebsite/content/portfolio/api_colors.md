Dominant color palette
<!--more-->

<img src="/img/portfolio/clrs_2.jpg" width="600">

For any catalog image we extract the dominant color palette and provide the RGB/hex value for the dominant colors.

Closest matching color terms at different levels of granularity.

Other closely similar colors.

The color terms come from our curated color taxonomy. A `color term`, also known as a color name, is a word or phrase that refers to a specific color. For example red is the color term used for a color with RGB values [255,0,0]. 

Color similarities are computed using the Delta E (CIE2000) metric in the LAB space.
